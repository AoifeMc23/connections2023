          <p>
            Aoife McNamara is a Videographer, Photographer and Visual Artist
            from Cork, Ireland in the early stages of her artist career. As a
            recent graduate of Creative Digital Media BA (Hons) from Munster
            Technological University, she has honed her skills in video editing
            and filmmaking through coursework and also through her professional
            work and freelance experience, becoming advanced in software such as
            Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe After Effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a passion for visual art and working with projectors and
            interactive technologies, she connected her knowledge and skills
            from her degree to explore using these technologies in an
            interactive installation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aoife’s latest project, “connections”, focuses on engaging the
            audience with technology and each other in a shared space. Audience
            members are invited into the installation where their audio data and
            hand movements are transformed into dynamic and colourful visual
            imagery that are projected onto the walls and floor. The visual
            output directly correlates to the audience size and volume levels.
            The methodologies behind her work involves an iterative process
            through thorough experiments where she explores the limits of her
            skills working different softwares and devices to create an
            interactive experience for the audience.

          <h1>PROJECT PROPOSAL SUMMARY</h1>

          <p>
            This project “connections”, is an interactive art installation that
            is generated by the audience's presence. The project aims to
            highlight the idea that our once social spaces are changing and
            becoming places of social collection, where people come together but
            do not speak to each other. (Turkle, 2011, p.155) By using the
            audience's presence and interactions it aims to highlight the idea
            of using interactive technology as a collective rather than an
            individual.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each audience member is invited to step into the installation both
            in the physical environment and the visual outputs. It uses
            interactive technologies to collectively engage the audience in a
            shared art piece where the audience’s input is the key factor.
            Without the audience, the piece doesn’t show and the more audience
            members there are, the more reactive and engaging the installation
            becomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The installation will contain two main elements that capture the
            audience's interactions and physical movements. Their audio data
            will be transformed into visuals that are projected onto the floor
            and the hand movements are tracked and projected onto the wall.
          </p>
          <p>
            This proposal is for the production of this installation in its full
            form that aims to be displayed in three art galleries in Ireland in
            2024. The amount that is being requested is: €17731.64

            “For hundreds of thousands of years, humans only communicated in
            person” and it is only just in the past fifty years we have started
            communicating online. (Lieberman and Schroeder, 2020, p16)
            Communication is one of “the most important factors shaping human
            destiny,” however, our once communal spaces such as a cafe or the
            park have become spaces of “social collection” where “people come
            together but do not speak to each other.” (McFarlane, 2010, p.1;
            Turkle, 2012, p.155) This shift in our society has created an
            imbalance where we are still learning about the impacts that
            technology has on our in person interactions with each other.
          </p>
          <p class="items_center">
            “Technology should be enhancing our connection to others, not
            replacing it.” - (CMHA, 2019)
          </p>
          <p>
            Digital technology in our lives has proven to be excellent in many
            different ways. Alongside social media it provided an outlet for
            adolescents during COVID-19, which was fundamental to help youth
            overcome the “stressful period and to limit psychological adverse
            events related to the lockdown.” (Salzano et al., 2021) However,
            despite its amazing qualities, in our personal relationships and in
            our offline connections with others it has been shown that it can
            have a negative effect on our relationships. (McDaniel and Coyne,
            2016)
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognising this shift in our society, this project is an
            interactive environment that is displayed in a shared environment
            where the audience is invited to interact both with each other and
            the piece itself. It aims to give the audience a space to explore
            ways in which interactive, digital technology can be used in a
            shared environment, where the audience collectively contributes to
            the visual output. Using visual arts as a medium, it uses software
            to transform the audience's movement and audio data to create the
            visuals for the piece which are then projected onto the floor and
            the wall using two projectors.
          </p>

          <h2><b>TECHNICAL DETAILS</b></h2>
          <p>
            There are two main elements of interactive graphics that are
            produced in this installation. The first is the audience’s audio
            input. The audience’s audio levels are captured through microphones
            around the room and brought into the software Touchdesigner. In real
            time, the audio input is collected and used to create graphics that
            are then projected onto the floor.
          </p>

          <div class="items_center">
            <video class="detail_videos" playsinline autoplay loop muted>
              <source src="assets\installation_audio.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            </video>
            <p>
              <i
                >Video of colourful visuals that are influenced from the
                audience's audio input</i
              >
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            The second is the audience’s physical bodies, specifically their
            hands. Using an Xbox Kinect, their right hand’s movement is tracked
            and projected directly onto the wall where each audience member can
            control their own circular bubble. When their bubbles overlap they
            interact and merge together creating new colors and forms.
          </p>

          <div class="items_center">
            <video class="detail_videos" playsinline autoplay loop muted>
              <source
                src="assets\installation_xboxKinect.mp4"
                type="video/mp4"
              />
            </video>
            <p>
              <i
                >Video of colourful and dynamic visuals that are influenced by
                the audience's hand movements</i
              >
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The project uses Touchdesigner to create the graphics with the
            audience's input coming from Xbox Kinect’s v2 and microphones. The
            interactive graphics are then projected on one wall and the floor
            where the audience can interact with the project and immediately see
            the results of their connections with each other.
          </p>

            would look like for the audience when they walk into the
            installation space. They are met with the projections from two
            projectors which cover one wall and one floor.

          <h2><b>EXPECTED RESULTS AND BENEFITS</b></h2>
          <p>
            As an artist whose interests and passions revolve around interactive
            technology, the proposed project aims to share the feeling that an
            immersive experience can have. It gives the audience a chance to
            reflect on the power and impact that using digital technology has on
            each other.

            The key activities involved in the production of this project are
            laid out over a six month period. In this time, there are six main
            phases. These include finding an art space, building the
            installation, testing and troubleshooting, implementation in the art
            space, publicity and creating awareness of the project and the final
            showcase.
